# Phase-1-Project

Our Project is going to be a memorizing card game. There will be a list of face down cards and you have to flip them to find the matches. When you get all the matches, you win the game.

The game will be Rick and Morty themed, so we will be using the Rick and Morty API to retrieve all the data.

Before the game starts, you can choose the theme of the cards' backs and the difficulty you would prefer. We will also have a high score feature where you can see your past scores.

Some event listeners we are going to use are: click, submit, mouseover.
